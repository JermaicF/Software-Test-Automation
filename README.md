# Software-Test-Automation

One of the most important ways I ensure my code is functional and secure is by writing unit tests early and using them to verify both valid and invalid behavior. Testing input validation prevents malformed data from entering the system, which protects the integrity of the application and reduces future bugs. I also use exception handling and clear data constraints to prevent crashes and unexpected runtime issues.

To interpret user needs, I begin by turning the requirements into specific, testable behaviors. Instead of coding until something “looks right,” I check whether each feature meets the exact rule the user asked for. For example, a phone number requirement becomes a validation test that enforces the exact length and format. This helps the final program align with what users expect, not just what the developer assumes.

When designing software, I focus on organization and clarity by separating responsibilities into small classes and methods. Each class serves a single purpose, which makes the code easier to maintain and easier to test. I also think through edge cases during design, so the code can handle both typical user behavior and unexpected input. This approach leads to code that is not only more reliable but also easier to expand in the future.
